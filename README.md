# vending machine console application

Fourth week of Tech Elevator worked on a pair programming assignment creating a vending machine console application using Java, following OOP. 
This project has a menu and a submenu. When the console app is started, it reads in an inventory file, updating what items are in each slot based on the contents of the file.
There is functionality to:
1) See a display of all items available for purchase
2) Deposit money into the vending machine
3) Purchase items from the vending machine
4) Return change when customer is finished purchasing items (using the smallest amount of coins possible)
5) Creates a log file that tracks:
    -when the vending machine is accessed
    -each time a customer feeds in money
    -each purchase
    -each completed transaction
6) Creates a sales report. This is a hidden menu option to see the total sales since the machine was last started. The sales report is displayed in the console and also written to a txt file.
